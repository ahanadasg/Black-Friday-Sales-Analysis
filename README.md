## Steps to replicate.
1.	Explore Kaggle Datasets:
Go to the Kaggle Datasets page (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) to explore the available datasets. You can search for specific datasets using keywords or browse through various categories.

2.	Select a Black Friday Sales Dataset:
Look for a dataset that interests you or aligns with your analysis objectives.Click on a dataset to access its details, including a description, file format, size, and any associated kernels or notebooks.
3.	 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pranavuikey/black-friday-sales-eda
Using the above dataset for current project.

4.	Download the Dataset:
If the dataset is available for download, click the "Download" button to save it to your local machine. Make sure to note the file path where you downloaded the dataset.

5.	To load a dataset using Python in Google Colab, follow these steps:
Access Google Colab:
Go to https://colab.research.google.com/ and sign in with your Google account.
If you don't have a Google account, you can create one for free.
Create a New Colab Notebook:
Click on the "New Notebook" button to create a new Colab notebook.

6.	Upload the Dataset to Google Colab:
In google colab, you can upload a CSV file using this line of Code.
from google.colab import files
upload=files.upload()
When you run this cell, you will receive a prompt to “browse” your files and upload the file that you want to upload.

7.	After you have uploaded the CSV file, now it is time to read the CSV file. 

8.	Let's walk through a basic Black Friday sales data analysis using Python and some popular data analysis libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib. 
9.	Explore the data: Display the first few rows of the dataset; Get a summary of the dataset; Check for missing values; Describe the numerical columns
